# FOAM Examples

Source code for [some of these videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ericsfoamvideos9833).

Each directory already has a `foam-bin.js` bundle, so you can simply open the
`src/index.html` file for each project and see what it looks like.

You can also run `npm run build` in each project folder if for any reason you
wish to re-generate `foam-bin.js`, for example to update FOAM. Keep in mind
FOAM is updated frequently and this is not guarenteed to work.
